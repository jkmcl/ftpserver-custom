A hack to customize the directory listing format of org.apache.ftpserver:ftpserver-core:1.1.4.

1. Compile this project

2. Create directory `custom/lib` under directory where ftpserver was installed

3. Copy JAR created in step 1 to directory created in step 2

4. Overwrite file `bin/ftpd.sh` or `bin/ftpd.bat` with one from this project
